This is a modified version of `Tab Mover` addon for personal use only.

## Differences from the original:
- added options page
- toggle for the behaviour added in v0.8: switch to tab after move to window -- which is counterintuive 100% of time, e.g. when watching a video (multitasking)
- move tabs with a one-click toolbar icon (which made right click menu kind-of obsolete)
- switch to previously active tab with key (ctrl+alt+9)
- always move specific container to new window
